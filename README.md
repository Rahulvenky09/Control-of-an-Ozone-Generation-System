# Control-of-an-Ozone-Generation-System
In this  Project, we make use of two methodologies namely Supervisory Control  and DECK in MATLAB to design a local controller to control the ozone  generation system. Initially, we design a plant model comprising of components and interactions. Further, we design a specification model and then a supervisory control system fulfilling the specifications described in the problem. The designed supervisor follows the start-up and shutdown procedures within the ozone generation system. The proper supervisor in the ozone generation system would satisfy properties such as controllability, non-blocking condition and admissibility. We finally ensure that the specification and safety conditions are satisfied in an ozone generation system.
